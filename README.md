example of using a 3pin led strip using the Neopixel library


While being a TA for a college class I stumbled across this 3 pin led strip with only 5vin, Din, and GND as pins. 
I found that the NEOpixel library for arduino would allow me to create some designs on it.  

Still not sure of the brand of the LEDs since there are no markings on it anywhere.
